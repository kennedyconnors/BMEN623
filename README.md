# Retinal Blood Vessel Segmentation for Early Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

## Overview  
This project aims to develop a practical methodology for retinal blood vessel segmentation to facilitate the early detection of diabetic retinopathy. By utilizing fundamental image processing techniques such as contrast enhancement, noise reduction, and targeted segmentation, this work seeks to improve the accuracy and reliability of identifying vascular structures in fundus images.

## Objectives  

### **Aim 1: Develop a preprocessing pipeline for retinal fundus images**  
Enhance image quality through grayscale conversion, apply Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for contrast enhancement, and implement Gaussian filtering for noise reduction while preserving critical structures.  

### **Aim 2: Implement and refine blood vessel segmentation techniques**  
Apply edge detection methods (Sobel, Canny filters) and adaptive thresholding, complemented by morphological operations, to accurately extract retinal vascular networks.
